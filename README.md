##  📊 Shield Insurance – Business Performance Analysis (Power BI)

Shield Insurance is a customer-focused general insurance provider operating across multiple urban markets in India. The company operates across key metros including Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Indore. Policies are distributed through multiple channels such as offline agents, direct sales, mobile apps and web platforms, serving customers across different age groups and financial needs.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Management at Shield Insurance required a unified analytics solution to better understand overall business health and revenue performance. Existing reports did not provide a consolidated view of:

●  Revenue performance trends

●  Customer growth patterns

●  Sales channel efficiency

●  City-level performance contribution

●  Age-group behavior and preferences

●  Policy-wise business value

This lack of visibility made it difficult for management to make data-driven strategic decisions and identify growth opportunities across markets, policies and customer segments.
